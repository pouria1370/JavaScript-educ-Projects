# JavaScript-educ-Projects

Hello

this Project is completley primitive and elementry and just designed for 
showing how 
             1:Clean Code works (about Naming)
             2:Inheritance works (Component as baseClass and its subcomponents like LogMessage And ListProjects)
             3:OOP works (it is abit more hard in comparisson to Functional)
             4:Callback works (i am talking about using callBack Functins for traversing done and unfinished projects)
             5:Lose refrence for one addEventListner for reaching to new addEventListner(as GarbageCollection Goal)
             
Thank you
